        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>
		Most of the large-scale web applications and enterprise applications we use daily rely on datacenters for compute, storage, networking and security, commonly via cloud computing interfaces. There are many research questions around how to use the datacenter as a computing platform to architect the “best” applications, all while datacenter hardware is rapidly evolving. This is a graduate-level seminar on cloud and datacenter operating systems. We will study topics such as serverless computing, kernel bypass operating systems, tiered and far memory systems, hardware accelerators, and disaggregation. The goals of the class are to (1) learn about the challenges surrounding cloud and datacenter systems, (2) practice reading, analyzing, and presenting systems research papers on these topics, and (3) perform a semester-long research project and present findings to the class.

    <section id="course-structure">
        <h2>Course Structure</h2>
        <p>The course is structured into the following components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Semester-Long Project (40%)</li>
            <li>Reading Responses (30%)</li>
			<li>Class Discussion Lead (15%)</li>
            <li>Class Participation (10%)</li>
			<li>Warmup Assignment (5%)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

	<hr>
    <section id="reading-responses">
        <h2>Class Reading, Reading Responses (30%), and Class Participation (10%)</h2>
	<p>For each class, I will assign 1-2 papers for reading and a paper summary assignment. Readings and summaries must be completed before class:
	<ul>
		<li>Summaries are due the <b>evening before class</b>, <b>at 5:00 PM ET (posted in the calendar below)</b>. You <b>can miss up to three of these summaries</b> with no penalty towards your grade across the whole semester, no questions asked.
</li>
	<li>Reading and synthesizing systems papers takes time! I expect it to take at least 4-5 hours per week to complete the assigned reading per week and complete the summary assignments, so you are ready to participate in the class discussion.
	</li>
	<li>Finally, attendance is mandatory, as a large part of the class is an in-person discussion. However, it is fine to miss class ocassionally, especially if you are sick or have other extenuating circumstances.
	</li>
</p>
    </section>

	<hr>
    <section id="discussion-lead">
        <h2>Class Discussion Lead (15%)</h2>
		<p>
		You will sign up to lead the discussion for at least one class over the entire semester. This specifically involves:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Sharing a list of discussion points with the instructor <b>at least two weekdays in advance (Friday for a Tuesday class, or Tuesday for a Thursday class)</b>, to which the instructor will give feedback. Students leading discussion at the very beginning of the semester have more leeway on the deadline for discussion points.
			</li>
			<li>
				Reading your classmates' reading responses the evening before the lecture and incorporating elements from these into the discussion.
			</li>
			<li>
			Leading the class discussion on the day of class, by steering the class towards your list of discussion point.
			</li>
			<li>You can also optionally meet with the instructor to go over your discussion plan prior to the class.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
    </section>

    <section id="warmup-assignment">
        <h2>Warmup Assignment (5%)</h2>
		The goal of the warmup assignment is to familiarize students with <a href=https://www.cloudlab.us/>Cloudlab</a>, so students may use it as an experimentation platform for their projects:
		<ul>
			<li> The assignment will be posted by <b>Thursday, September 6</b>.</li>
			<li>The assignment is due on <b>Tuesday, September 17</b>.</li>
		</ul>
    </section>
    <hr>

    <section id="class-project">
        <h2>Semester-Long Project (40%)</h2>
		More details about the project are forthcoming. An ideal project could later become a strong submission to a systems conference such as OSDI, SOSP, ATC, Eurosys, or NSDI. Some administrative notes about the project:

		<ul>

			<li>Projects should be completed ideally in <b>groups of 2-3</b>; if you really would like to work alone, please see me after class, and we can discuss your situation.
			</li>
			<li> You are allowed to use external research projects for the class project, as long as:
				<ul>
					<li>The topic of the research has a clear overlap with the topics and themes of the class.</li>
					<li> You discuss the situation with me beforehand, before the proposal is due.</li>
					<li>You discuss with your other collaborators on the project and they are ok with you using the research as your class project.</li>
					<li> If the project involves student collaborators external to the class, you must give sufficient evidence to prove you are leading or co-leading the project (e.g., you would either be first or co-first author if submitted for publication) and you must explicitly lay out which parts of the project you are responsible for.
					</li>
				</ul>
		</li>
		<li> You are allowed to use the same project as another seminar (2000-level) class, as long as:
				<ul>
					<li>You clear the situation with me and <b>the instructor of the other class</b>.	
					</li>
					<li>
						The topic of the research has clear overlap with the themes of this course.
					</li>
				</ul>
		</li>

        <h2>Collaboration Policy</h2>
		<p>
		You are allowed (and in fact encouraged) to discuss readings, reading questions, and the warmup assignments with others (including people who might not be in this class). However:
<ul>
	<li>However, all answers you submit must be written by you. Your response should not be copied from anyone else and should not be generated automatically using chatbots.</li>
	<li>
	For the warmup assignment, while you can discuss your implementations with others, you must write code and responses to the assignment questions yourself.
	</li>
	<li>
		Additionally, you must understand your answers; we reserve the right to interview you about your work to ensure you understand your submissions.
	</li>
	<li>
		You must cite all sources (people, websites, papers, etc.) that you consult as a part of your work. 
	</li>
</ul>


A word about citing: as you can see we require you to cite any external sources you use for the class. External sources here include but are not limited to previously published articles, blog posts, Stackoverflow or similar sites, conversations with other people, etc. This policy is not meant to discourage the use of external sources, instead it just codifies a standard academic practice. You should be generous with your citations.
<br>
<br>
Finally, by taking this class, you agree to never post any solutions for the warmup assignment publicly.
